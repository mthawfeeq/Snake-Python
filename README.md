# Snake-Python

- Implemented the classic Arcade game Snake using the Turtle class in Python.
- Made entirely using Object Oriented Programming approach as opposed to the Procedural style of programming. 
- Setup an external data file that stores the highscores even after exiting from the game.
- As soon as the snake takes in food, the speed of the snake's movements along with the size of the snake increases. 
- The game ends when the snake hits either the wall or itself.
